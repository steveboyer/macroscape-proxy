# macrosight-proxy backlog

This file is the single source of truth for macrosight-proxy's backlog and history.

Every item has a permanent ID (`MSP###`). Refer to items by ID. New items take the next free number (currently **MSP040** is next). IDs never change once assigned, even if items are reordered, edited, or completed.

## Active backlog

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **MSP008** — Local dev workflow: esbuild watch, `sam local invoke` or equivalent for endpoint testing, dotenv-style local config that mirrors Secrets Manager keys without committing values.

- [ ] **MSP033** — Add `permissions: contents: read` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope is explicit and immune to org/repo setting drift.

- [ ] **MSP034** — Add `concurrency: { group: deploy, cancel-in-progress: false }` to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` so two merges to `main` in quick succession serialize through `cdk deploy` instead of racing.

- [ ] **MSP036** — Enable branch protection on `main`: require PR before merge, require CI to pass, disallow force-pushes and deletions. Public repo with an OIDC-trusted deploy role makes this load-bearing.

- [ ] **MSP037** — Don't populate the `macrosight-proxy/upstream-api-key` secret in production until handler-side auth (MSP010–MSP012) is in place. The `HttpApi` `/{proxy+}` route is currently unauthenticated and public; that's harmless while the handler just echoes JSON, but the moment the secret is populated and the handler reads it, the open endpoint becomes a wallet-drain vector against Anthropic.

- [ ] **MSP038** — Pin GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/*.yml` to commit SHAs rather than `@v4` major-version tags. Particularly load-bearing for `deploy.yml`, which has IAM deploy permissions via OIDC. Configure Dependabot (or similar) to keep the pinned SHAs current.

- [ ] **MSP039** — Full rename macrosight → macroscape (the painful one). MSP006 already moved the public surface (`api.macroscape.app`); everything else is still macrosight-branded. Touches:

      - **GitHub repo**: `steveboyer/macrosight-proxy` → `steveboyer/macroscape-proxy`. Auto-redirect handles old URLs but the OIDC trust subject claim must match exactly — update `githubRepo: 'macrosight-proxy'` in `lib/github-oidc-stack.ts`. Update local `git remote set-url origin`. Update CI badge URL in `README.md`.
      - **CFN stack names**: `MacrosightProxyStack` → `MacroscapeProxyStack` and `MacrosightProxyGithubOidcStack` → `MacroscapeProxyGithubOidcStack` in `bin/macrosight-proxy.ts` (rename the file too). Rename is a **replacement** — CFN deletes the old stack and creates the new one. The DynamoDB table, Route 53 zone, and Secrets Manager secrets survive (RETAIN). On recreate, CDK fails to create secrets with the same name unless the orphans are deleted first or imported via `Secret.fromSecretNameV2` — pick one strategy.
      - **IAM deploy role**: `MacrosightProxyGithubDeployRole` → `MacroscapeProxyGithubDeployRole` (in `github-oidc-stack.ts`). Update `role-to-assume` ARN in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Update the `cdk deploy` stack name there and the `cdk synth` stack name in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
      - **Secret name prefixes** (`macrosight-proxy/...` → `macroscape-proxy/...`): decide whether to rename + reseed or leave as-is.
      - **Repo-level**: `package.json` `name`, README title and copy, CLAUDE.md mentions, local working directory.
      - **Do NOT renumber `MSP###` issue IDs** — they're immutable. Prefix stays.

      Suggested sequencing: rename the GitHub repo first (lowest blast radius); redeploy `MacroscapeProxyGithubOidcStack` with the new role name and update the deploy workflow ARN; then rename the main stack. Expect a few minutes of API downtime during the API Gateway recreate even though the alias records survive.

### Auth

- [ ] **MSP009** — Apple Developer Sign-In configuration: services ID, key, team ID. Document the values needed in README and store the private key in Secrets Manager (MSP005).

- [ ] **MSP010** — Apple ID token verification: fetch and cache JWKS, validate signature, check `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` claims. Reject tokens that fail any check with 401.

- [ ] **MSP011** — Auto-create user record in DynamoDB on first authenticated request. Idempotent: subsequent requests look up rather than recreate.

- [ ] **MSP012** — `/health` endpoint that authenticates the caller and returns the verified user identity. First end-to-end auth proof point.

### Forwarding

- [ ] **MSP013** — `/v1/messages` POST handler that proxies to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`. Body passed through unchanged.

- [ ] **MSP014** — Header rewriting: strip the caller's Authorization header, attach the Anthropic API key from Secrets Manager, preserve content-type and other Anthropic-required headers (e.g., `anthropic-version`, `anthropic-beta` for prompt caching).

- [ ] **MSP015** — Streaming response support if MacroSight uses streaming on any call shape. If not, mark this complete with a note that streaming was not needed.

- [ ] **MSP016** — Sanitized upstream error pass-through. Forward Anthropic's status codes and a safe subset of error details, never the full upstream response (which may contain implementation details we don't want to leak).

### Rate limiting

- [ ] **MSP017** — Daily request counter in DynamoDB keyed by user and date. Atomic increment via `UpdateItem` with `ADD`.

- [ ] **MSP018** — Configurable per-user daily limit. Return 429 with `Retry-After` header when exceeded. Default limit set in CDK config, overridable per user via DynamoDB attribute.

### Observability and security

- [ ] **MSP019** — Structured CloudWatch logging with secret redaction. JSON log shape: `requestId`, `userId`, `route`, `latencyMs`, `upstreamStatus`. Anthropic API key and Apple private key never appear in logs (assert via lint rule or test).

- [ ] **MSP020** — Request ID propagation. Generate or accept an inbound request ID header, attach it to every log line and to the upstream Anthropic call.

- [ ] **MSP021** — IAM least-privilege audit on the Lambda execution role. Limit to specific DynamoDB table ARN, specific Secrets Manager secret ARNs, and CloudWatch Logs only.

- [ ] **MSP035** — Remove the `console.log('event', JSON.stringify(event))` line in `src/handler.ts` before MSP010 lands. Once auth is in place, that line would log inbound `Authorization` JWTs to CloudWatch. Land alongside or before the structured logging work in MSP019.

### Testing

- [ ] **MSP022** — Unit tests for Apple ID token verification using fixture JWTs (valid, expired, wrong issuer, wrong audience, malformed).

- [ ] **MSP023** — Integration test for `/v1/messages` happy path with a mocked Anthropic upstream and a mocked Apple JWKS.

### Documentation

- [ ] **MSP024** — README covering architecture overview, local dev setup, AWS prerequisites, deploy steps, and how to rotate the Anthropic key.

- [ ] **MSP025** — Mermaid architecture diagram in README showing iOS app, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, and Anthropic upstream.

---

## Future / longer-term

- [ ] **MSP026** — Plan tiers (free vs paid) with differentiated rate limits. Stored on user record, enforced in MSP018 logic.

- [ ] **MSP027** — Detailed per-call audit log in a dedicated DynamoDB table beyond CloudWatch. Useful for billing reconciliation and abuse forensics.

- [ ] **MSP028** — CloudWatch billing alarms for cost protection. Trigger SNS notification at configured monthly spend thresholds.

- [ ] **MSP029** — AWS WAF rules in front of API Gateway for basic abuse protection (rate limit by IP, block obvious scanner patterns).

- [ ] **MSP030** — Multi-region deployment with latency-based routing. Likely overkill for current scale; revisit if launch demand warrants.

- [ ] **MSP031** — Admin endpoint for usage review (auth-protected, single-user for now).

- [ ] **MSP032** — Migrate AIRequestLog inspection from the iOS client to a proxy-side store. Trade: better central observability, larger blast radius if compromised. Decide based on launch posture.

## Done

(Most recent first; ID order is reverse-chronological.)

- [x] **MSP006** — Custom domain via Route 53 hosted zone plus ACM certificate plus API Gateway custom domain mapping.

      Project rebranded MacroSight → Macroscape; API serves at `api.macroscape.app`. `lib/macrosight-proxy-stack.ts` now provisions a `HostedZone` for `macroscape.app` (RETAIN on destroy), an ACM `Certificate` for `api.macroscape.app` DNS-validated against the zone, an APIGW v2 `DomainName` wired as `defaultDomainMapping` on `HttpApi`, and A + AAAA alias records pointing at `ApiGatewayv2DomainProperties`. Stack outputs the four `HostedZoneNameServers` so they can be copied to the registrar. First deploy hangs on cert validation until NS delegation propagates — minutes, not hours, in practice. Stack and repo names (`MacrosightProxyStack`, `macrosight-proxy`) intentionally unchanged — renaming would orphan the CFN stack and break the OIDC role's trust-policy subject claim; track separately if desired.

- [x] **MSP005** — AWS Secrets Manager entries for the Anthropic API key and the Apple Sign-In private key. No secret values in code or environment variables committed to git.

      `lib/macrosight-proxy-stack.ts`: `UpstreamApiKey` (`macrosight-proxy/upstream-api-key`) was already in place from `1daa0c4`; added `AppleSignInPrivateKey` (`macrosight-proxy/apple-signin-private-key`) for client_secret JWT signing against Apple's token endpoint. Both secrets are created empty — populate post-deploy via console/CLI. Lambda gets `grantRead` on both and the ARNs surface via `UPSTREAM_SECRET_ARN` / `APPLE_SIGNIN_SECRET_ARN` env vars. Apple ID-token verification (MSP010) uses JWKS, not this private key — the private key is for the auth-code-exchange / token-revocation paths.

- [x] **MSP002** — Lambda function definition on ARM Graviton2 architecture, sized at the smallest memory tier that handles the workload (start at 512 MB, tune later).

      `lib/macrosight-proxy-stack.ts`: added `architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64` and bumped `memorySize` 256 → 512 per the item's stated starting point. Tune downward once the real handler (MSP013–MSP016) is in place and there's profile data to inform the choice.

- [x] **MSP004** — DynamoDB single-table design. PK conventions: `USER#{appleUserId}` for user records, `USAGE#{appleUserId}` with SK `DATE#{YYYY-MM-DD}` for usage records. TTL attribute on usage rows so old counters auto-expire.

      CDK table from `1daa0c4` (`TableV2` with generic `pk`/`sk`/`ttl`) plus the schema-conventions module `src/db/keys.ts`: `userKey`, `usageKey`, `usageTtl` (epoch seconds at end-of-UTC-day + 90-day default retention). End-of-day normalization means rows written at 00:01 and 23:59 of the same date expire together. UTC reset boundary so per-day limits behave consistently across user timezones. Nothing exercises the helpers yet — MSP011 / MSP017 will be the first consumers; fix forward if those reveal a problem.

- [x] **MSP007** — GitHub Actions workflow for CDK synth and deploy on push to `main`. OIDC-based AWS auth (no long-lived access keys in repo secrets).

      Done in `8410ec1` (`GithubOidcStack` provisions the OIDC provider + `MacrosightProxyGithubDeployRole`, restricted to `repo:steveboyer/macrosight-proxy:ref:refs/heads/main`) and `cbe75c7` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint/format/tsc/synth; `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` assumes the deploy role via `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` and runs `cdk deploy MacrosightProxyStack --require-approval never`). Hardening follow-ups split out as MSP033 / MSP034 / MSP036.

- [x] **MSP003** — API Gateway HTTP API with Lambda proxy integration. HTTP API rather than REST API; only the routes actually needed.

      Done in `1daa0c4`. `HttpApi` + `HttpLambdaIntegration` in `lib/macrosight-proxy-stack.ts`. Single catch-all `/{proxy+}` route on any method — fine while the handler is a placeholder; tighten to specific routes once MSP012 / MSP013 land.

- [x] **MSP001** — CDK app skeleton in TypeScript with esbuild bundling, Node.js 20 runtime target.

      Done in `cbcaae3` (scaffold) and `1daa0c4` (`NodejsFunction` with esbuild bundling). Runtime is `NODEJS_22_X` rather than 20 — moved forward to match the project's pinned `.nvmrc` / `engines.node`.
